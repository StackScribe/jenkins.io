= Configure System

Use the *Manage Jenkins >> System Configuration* page to configure
many standard aspects of your Jenkins server, including:

** JDK installations
** Build tools - Ant and Maven installations
** Version control tools
** Email configuration

This page discusses the fields that are present after a standard Jenkins installation using the "Suggested plugins".
Plugins installed on your system may add sections to this page.

You can set these configurations using the Jenkins dashboard as described here or you can set them using Configuration as Code, where you define the configuration you want in a YAML file that you then deploy to a server to configure Jenkins.
See link:http://localhost:4242/doc/book/managing/casc/[Configuration as Code]
for more information.

== General system-wide configurations

The top of the System Configuration page
sets basic information about the controller:

* *Home Directory* -- Display the location of the Jenkins home directory.
You can change this location
by modifying the value of the `JENKINS_HOME` environment variable.

* *System Message* -- Text that is displayed
at the top of your Jenkins home page.
Use this page to display the name of the server
and a short description of its purpose.
It is also used to display announcements about scheduled down time
and other information of interest to all Jenkins users.
This field can include HTML tags
or a pointer to a Wiki page and information about who to contact.

Inline help is available for most fields on most *Manage Jenkins* pages.
To access the help, select the *?* icon to the right of each field.
Click the *?* icon again to hide the help text.

== Executors on controller

The *# of executors* field configures the number of executors on the controller.
Typically, this should be set to 0 to prevent builds from running on the controller.
We will discuss executors for nodes and agents in a later section.

== Quiet period

This field defines an interval to wait before actually starting a build.
This can be used to collapse multiple adjacent commits into one build.

////
These fields no longer appear on the *System Configuration* page.
== SCM tools

This field configures tools on the controller itself;
it does not control the tools that are configured in a build agent
for running builds.

Git is supported out-of-the-box.
Plugin support is provided for
Subversion, Mercurial, Perforce, Team Foundation Server, and other SCMs.
In most cases, the plugin for the tool must be installed separately
before you configure the tool on the System Configuration page.

== SCM and authentication

Most SCM tools support or require authentication when talking to servers.
Different SCMs are configured differently,
but most (including Git, SVN, Mercurial, and Team Foundation Server)
use the Credentials plugin.
However, Perforce requires that each project
enters credentials separately.
////

== Jenkins location

You must configure the **Jenkins Location** area
to identify this particular instance of Jenkins.

Two items must be defined here:

* *Jenkins URL* -- Replace the `localhost:5000` string with information
about the actual location people can use to access this Jenkins instance.
This information can be:

** The actual URL that people use to access Jenkins.
** The host alias as defined by the name service.
If your IT people cannot provide this, use dynamic DNS.
This makes your instance easier for your users to access
and makes your service relocatable.

[NOTE]
====
*Invest in a good URL!*
If your users cannot see Jenkins, much of the benefit is lost.
Make the URL easy to  remember.  For example:

* Bad: `\http://tjek-02.int.rev.example.org`
* Good: `\https://jenkins.example.org`
====

* *System Admin e-mail address* -- Define the email address to which email
about general Jenkins issues are sent.
This can be an individual's email address
or an email alias that contains multiple email addresses.

== Timestamper

The **Timestamper** fields define the format used
to display timestamp information.

== More about system configuration

Jenkins is very flexible and powerful.
Default configurations can be used for most fields while you are getting started.
As you learn more about how Jenkins works and how your project uses Jenkins,
you can modify the values of settings on this page.
Use these settings to fine-tune the behavior of your Jenkins instance.

When you are done modifying this screen,
scroll to the bottom and click
*Save* to apply your configuration changes.

== Management options

Select **Managment Options** to start, stop, and reload the Jenkins service.

To reload the configuration from disk,
Jenkins rereads the configuration from `$JENKINS_HOME`
without restarting Jenkins.

The **Prepare for Shutdown** option
prevents new jobs from being started
and waits for running jobs to complete.
Use this option to ensure a clean job termination before you shut down or restart Jenkins.

The Management page provides Jenkins Upgrade management.
If you are running a standalone server,
you can perform a one-click upgrade.
Otherwise, you have a direct link to the latest WAR.

**Manage Old Data** helps to handle dropped configuration items after an upgrade.

== What did we learn?
////

== Jenkins home directory

Jenkins stores its global configuration in files on the Jenkins controller.
Administrators and privileged users modify the global configuration from the Jenkins configuration pages.

The `JENKINS_HOME` directory is the root of the directory structure on disk that Jenkins uses to perform builds and keep archives.
The Jenkins home directory is listed in *Manage Jenkins* > *System* under the *Home directory* heading.

image:/images/system-administration/administering-jenkins/home-dir.png[Home dir]

* On Windows by default, this is set to `C:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins`.
* On Ubuntu by default, this is set to `~/.jenkins`.

But you can change this in one of the following ways:

* Set the `JENKINS_HOME` environment variable.
* Set the `JENKINS_HOME` Java system property.

You can change this location after you've used Jenkins for a while, too.
To do this:

. Stop Jenkins completely.
. Move the contents from the old `JENKINS_HOME` to the new location.
. Set the `JENKINS_HOME` variable to the new location.
. Restart Jenkins.

The directory structure of the `JENKINS_HOME` tree is often structured as follows:
[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
....
JENKINS_HOME
 +- builds            (build records)
    +- [BUILD_ID]     (subdirectory for each build)
         +- build.xml      (build result summary)
         +- changelog.xml  (change log)
 +- config.xml         (Jenkins root configuration file)
 +- *.xml              (other site-wide configuration files)
 +- fingerprints       (stores fingerprint records, if any)
 +- identity.key.enc   (RSA key pair that identifies an instance)
 +- jobs               (root directory for all Jenkins jobs)
     +- [JOBNAME]      (sub directory for each job)
         +- config.xml (job configuration file)
     +- [FOLDERNAME]   (sub directory for each folder)

     +- [PLUGIN].jpi   (.jpi or .hpi file for the plugin)
 +- secret.key         (deprecated key used for some plugins' secure operations)

     +- hudson.util.Secret   (used for encrypting some Jenkins data)
     +- master.key           (used for encrypting the hudson.util.Secret key)
