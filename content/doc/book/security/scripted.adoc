Apache Groovy scripts can be executed on the Jenkins controller and agents through various mechanisms including:

* link:/doc/book/managing/script-console/[Script Console]
* link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/groovy/[Groovy plugin]
when using the "Execute system Groovy script" step
* link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/email-ext/[Extended Email plugin]
* link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/groovy/[Job DSL plugin]
* link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/[Pipelines]

Scripts are powerful and useful tools but they must be managed carefully
to ensure that they are not used to compromise your installation:

* Limit the people to whom the *Overall/Administer* permission is granted.
This allows people to use the
link:/doc/book/managing/script-console/[Script Console].
This authorization allows one to type in and execute an Apache Groovy script
in a largely unrestricted environment
so it should only be available to highly trusted, sophisticated users.


Two facilities are provided that allow users with lesser permissions
(such as *Job/Configure* or *Job/Build*) to run scripts that may be associated with plugins or their applications:

* Jenkins maintains a list of "approved" scripts that cannot do any damage.
If a user attempts to run a script that is not approved,
the script is blocked until an administrator reviews the script and approves it
using the _Manage Jenkins Â» In-process Script Approval_ screen.
See the link:/doc/book/managing/script-approval/[In-process Script Approval] documentation for more information.
In most cases, you should use the
link:/doc/book/managing/script-approval/#approve-assuming-permissions-check[Approve assuming permissions check] option rather than the simple Approve option.

* Groovy scripts can be run in the
link:/doc/book/managing/script-approval/#groovy-sandbox[Groovy Sandbox] without approval.
Each method call, object construction, and field access is checked against a list of allowed operations.
If the script attempts to call any operations that are not allowed,
it is killed and the unallowed operation is added to an approval queue.
An administrator can approve that operation and then the script can be rerun.

* Scripts written in languages other than Groovy can be run by an administrator
or must be approved by an administrator;
the sandbox is only for Groovy scripts.

* Users can disable the Groovy sandbox.
The entire script must be approved by the administrator unless it is in the list of administrator-managed list of approved scripts.

This is an alternative to the preceding bullet item.
I am guessing that the documenttion reflects the current reality.

* You should never disable the sandbox. If you disable the sandbox, a Scripted Pipeline (or a `script` step in a Declarative Pipeline) has unfettered access to Jenkins internal objects.
For a light-hearted explanation about how dangerous this can be, see
