title: How Jenkins Executes Jobs
layout: section
---

A simple overview of how Jenkins executes a Freestyle or Pipeline job helps to understand the security considerations.
The execution sequence is similar for Freestyle and Pipeline jobs, with the following differences:

* Pipelines are controlled by a _Jenkinsfile_ that is written in a scripting language whereas Freestyle jobs are controlled from a configuration defined in the UI.
The scripting language supports features such as loops and allows more flexibility about when and where a build script executes;
these features also provide additional opportunities to do mischief.
* The _Jenkinsfile_ is stored under SCM, which can initiate its execution, so securing the SCM is also an important part of protecting the integrity of your Jenkins installation.

By default, a job executes with the full privileges of the Jenkins administrator, although you can configure Jenkins to execute jobs with fewer privileges.

All of the job's logic as well as a Pipeline's Groovy conditionals, loops, and so forth execute on the controller.

When the job runs:

* Jenkins creates a _workspace_ on the controller for each build that runs.
Files for that build are stored in the workspace.
* The job calls a series of _steps_, each of which is a script or command that does the real work and mostly executes using an _executor_ on an _agent_.

The agent:

* Writes some files to the local node.
* Sends data back to the controller.
* May also request information from the controller.

Many different people have some control over the commands that are executed during a build:

* Jenkins users with Job/Configure permission
* Authors of build scripts such as `pom.xml` and `Makefile`
* Authors of code, such as test suites that are executed during a build

Any of these could introduce security issues, either deliberately or accidentally.
In addition, supply chain attacks can occur on build dependencies, whereby attackers take over control of NPM or Maven packages and insert malicious code.

You can see the complexity of keeping your Jenkins instance secure.
In the following sections we discuss specific protections that Jenkins provides and practices that you can implement to protect Jenkins from intrusions.
