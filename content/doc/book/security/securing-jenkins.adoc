This page is a placeholder for links to some old Wiki pages until we can properly dispose of this information.

* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Quick+and+Simple+Security[Quick and Simple Security] --- if you are running Jenkins like `java -jar jenkins.war` and only need a very simple setup
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Standard+Security+Setup[Standard Security Setup] --- discusses the most common setup of letting Jenkins run its own user database and do finer-grained access control
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Apache+frontend+for+security[Apache frontend for security] --- run Jenkins behind Apache and perform access control in Apache instead of Jenkins
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Authenticating+scripted+clients[Authenticating scripted clients] --- if you need to programmatically access security-enabled Jenkins web UI, use BASIC auth
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Matrix-based+security[Matrix-based security|Matrix-based security] --- Granting and denying finer-grained permissions

In addition to access control of users, link:build-authorization[access control for builds] limits what builds can do, once started.
