Developers and maintainers of plugins play a crucial role in maintaining Jenkins security.
This page summarizes the security practices required. 

== Monitor Security Advisories

Monitor Jenkins
link:https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisories/[Security Advisories]
closely.
It may be necessary to modify your plugin to work and comply with security fixes.

== Store User Credentials as Secrets

Protect user credentials by storing them on disk in a field of type `Secret`
and never in a simple `String` field.
Protect user credentials by storing them on disk in a field of type `Secret`
and never in a simple `String` field.
Use a getter that returns the same type to access the `Secrets` field
from other code.
See
link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/security/secrets/[Storing Secrets]
for background information, instructions, and code examples.

== Script Security

Be sure that your plugin implements appropriate security
for custom Groovy scripts that users may need to create to customize Jenkins.

For more information, see the _Developer's Guide_ section of the
link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security/[Script Security] documentation.

== Provide Role Check for Callable

Communication between the Jenkins controller and agents is implemented with the Java
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Callable.html[Callable] interface.
Plugins should always implement a _role check_ that runs after a
`Callable` message to ensure that the object executes on the proper side of the controller-agent communication.
Jenkins 2.319 and Jenkins LTS 2.303.3 and later releases enforce this behavior.
A plugin that does not comply throws a `SecurityException` and logs an error message.

See

for more information.
