The Jenkins controller and agents can be thought of as a distributed process
which executes across multiple discrete processes and machines.
Not building on the built-in controller node is an essential practice
to protect the controller from bugs and less sophisticated attackers.
However, an agent can stil ask the controller process for information such as the contents of files,
and can even request that the controller run certain commands.
This means that an agent process taken over by a malicious user could still obtain data
or execute commands on the Jenkins controller.
To prevent this, Jenkins implements the **Agent &rarr; Controller Access Control** filter
that prevents agent processes from sending malicious commands to the Jenkins controller.

This filter may prevent your builds from executing legitimate operations.

* If builds are failing because of the agent-to-controller access control,
you should first ensure that you have upgraded to the latest version of all plugins,
since older versions of plugins may not work correctly with this feature.

* You can also tweak the filter's rules by adding `allow/deny` rules
to specify the commands that you need and the type of access that is allowed for the agent.
See
link:/doc/book/security/controller-isolation/agent-to-controller/[Customizing Agent -> Controller Security]
for more information.

It is also possible (but strongly discouraged) to disable this filter
by un-checking the box on the _Manage Jenkins Â» Configure Global Security_ page:

image::security/configure-global-security-agent-controller-toggle.png["Configure Global Security - Enable Agent => Controller Access Control", role=center]

IMPORTANT: It is strongly recommended that you not disable the Agent &rarr; Controller Access Control filter.
