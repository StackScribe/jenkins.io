The _Manage Jenkins >> Configure Global Security_ page allows a Jenkins administrator
to enable, configure, or disable key security features that apply to the entire
Jenkins environment.

In Jenkins 2.0 and later, many of the security options are enabled by default to
ensure that Jenkins environments remained secure unless an administrator
explicitly disables certain protections.

This section introduces fields available on the _Configure Global Security_ page
and provides links to other pages that explain
the protections offered. ways to tweak the protection, and trade-offs for disabling some of them.

== Access Control

Access Control is the primary mechanism for securing a Jenkins environment
against unauthorized usage. Two facets of configuration are necessary for
configuring Access Control in Jenkins:

. A *Security Realm* which informs the Jenkins environment how and where to
  pull user (or identity) information from. Also commonly known as "authentication."
. *Authorization* configuration which informs the Jenkins environment as to
  which users and/or groups can access which aspects of Jenkins, and to what
  extent.

Using both the Security Realm and Authorization configurations it is possible
to configure very relaxed or very rigid authentication and authorization
schemes in Jenkins.
