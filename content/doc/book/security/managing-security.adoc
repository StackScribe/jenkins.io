The _Manage Jenkins >> Configure Global Security_ page allows a Jenkins administrator
to enable, configure, or disable key security features that apply to the entire
Jenkins environment.

In Jenkins 2.0 and later, many of the security options are enabled by default to
ensure that Jenkins environments remained secure unless an administrator
explicitly disables certain protections.

This section introduces fields available on the _Configure Global Security_ page
and provides links to other pages that explain
the protections offered, ways to tweak the protection, and trade-offs for disabling some of them.

TODO: Justify this with the actual UI page so it includes all fields in a reasonable order.

link:/doc/book/security/access-control[Jenkins Access Control]::
During installation, Jenkins creates the "admin" user who has full permissions to do everything and does not allow anonymous access..
Use the *Security Realm* and *Authorization* blocks on this page
to safely add and manage additional users and grant them appropriate permissions.
Note that, if the setup wizard is disabled on first launch, access may not be configured securely by default.

link:/doc/book/security/tcp-port[TCP Port for Inbound Agents]::
Inbound agents (such as Windows agents) require a TCP port.
By default, this port is disabled.
If your builds use inbound agents, you must configure this port.
If your builds do not use inbound agents, you should leave this port disabled.
Note also that it may be able to implement this functionality using SSH or the WebSocket Transport.

The **Global Security Settings** screen
also includes fields to configure or enable
filters that protect against common types of intrusion.
By default, Jenkins is installed in "locked-down" mode so that
all of these filters are turned on.
You should leave these filters enabled unless they interfere with the jobs you need to run,
although in many cases you can tweak the filter
but still leave it enabled.
In many cases, plugins and practices are available
to reduce the security vulnerability of these features.

* link:/doc/book/security/markup-formatter/[Markup Formatters]::
Controls how HTML formatting in descriptions is handled.
The default markup formatter renders text as entered (i.e. escaping HTML metacharacters).
Some of these characters can be used maliciously, so the default is _Plain text_ but plugins are available that allow some of the formatting to be rendered.

* link:/doc/book/security/csrf-protection[CSRF Protection]::
CSRF is an exploit that enables an unauthorized third party
to perform requests against a web application
by impersonating another, authenticated user.
In a Jenkins environment, a CSRF attack could allow
a malicious actor to delete projects,
alter builds, or modify the system configuration of the Jenkins instance.
Jenkins protects from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) by default.
This page explains how to work around any problems this may cause.
// TODO Confirm that skipping the setup wizard in 2.222 no longer disables CSRF protection

* The Agent &rarr; Controller Access Control filter
prevents an agent from sending malicious commands to the controller:
See
link:/doc/book/security/controller-isolation/#agent-controller-security[Agent &rarr; Controller Security] for more information.
It can not be disabled from the UI although the filter's rules can be tweaked when necessary.
