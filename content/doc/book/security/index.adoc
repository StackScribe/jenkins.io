Jenkins is used everywhere -- from workstations on corporate intranets to high-powered servers connected to the public internet.
It is critically important to keep your Jenkins instance secure,both to protect your information and to avoid executing malicious code from your Jenkins instance.

Your Jenkins environment is a fully-distributed build system.
Each network connection is a potential point of entry.

Jenkins and the jobs it runs must be able to do almost anything, which means that  the code that runs your builds can be perverted to run anything!
For example, a malicious Pipeline could reconfigure the Jenkins instance, delete files, or launch various forms of mischief such as a DDoS attack or a bot.
In addition to deliberate and direct attacks on your environment, a trusted user could visit an infected web site and accidentally introduce malicious code into the Jenkins instance.

Jenkins includes configurable features to secure your Jenkins instance against the various security and threat profiles.
The setup wizard enables many of the security options by default,
to ensure that Jenkins is secure.
Other security options involve environment-specific setup and trade-offs and depend on specific use cases supported for individual Jenkins instances.
Configuration options allow you to enable, customize, or disable security features.

[CAUTION]
====
Most Jenkins environments grow over time, requiring their trust models to evolve as the environment grows.
You should schedule regular "check-ups" of your security settings to ensure that they are still appropriate for your instance.
In particular, if you had to disable some of the default protections that Jenkins provides,
perhaps because you were using a plugin that had not been updated to support that protection, you may be able to re-enable that protection to increase the security of your instance.

This chapter introduces the various security options available to Jenkins administrators and users, explaining the protections offered, and trade-offs to disabling some of them:

link:concepts-security[Background Concepts]::
Discusses security principles that should guide all your decisions about security
and explains how Jenkins executes a Pipeline so you understand where intrusions can occur if your security configuration is lax.

link:controller-isolation[Distributed Builds]::
Builds should not be executed on the built-in node, but that is just the beginning:
This section discusses what other steps can be taken to protect the controller from being impacted by running builds.
*This needs to be configured according to the needs of your environment.*

link:managing-security[Configure Global Security]::
Much of the basic security configuration is implemented on the _Manage Jenkins >> Configure Global Security_ page.
Here you see the fields that are configured on that page and get links to other sections that explain each field in detail.

link:access-control[Jenkins Access Control]::
By default, Jenkins does not allow anonymous access, and a single admin user exists.
This chapter discusses which level of access is provided by permissions and how to safely grant access to more users.
_This is set up securely by the setup wizard. If the setup wizard is disabled on first launch, this may not be configured securely by default._

link:tcp-port[TCP Port for InBound Agents]::
If you are using TCP for inbound agents (previously called JNLP),
you must configure a TCP port to use.
This section discusses how to configure the TCP port and discusses alternative implementations that do not require the TCP port.

link:markup-formatter[Markup Formatter]::
The default markup formatter renders text as entered (i.e. escaping HTML metacharacters).
This chapter explains how to switch to a different markup formatter and explains what admins need to be aware of.
_This is set up securely by default._

link:csrf-protection[CSRF Protection]::
Jenkins protects from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) by default.
This chapter explains how to work around any problems this may cause.
_This is set up securely by default._
// TODO Confirm that skipping the setup wizard in 2.222 does no longer disable CSRF protection

link:user-content[Rendering User Content]::
By default, Jenkins strictly limits the features useable in user content (files from workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.) it serves.
This chapter discusses how to customize this and make HTML reports and similar content both functional and safe to view.
_This is set up securely by default._

link:build-authorization[Access Control for Builds]::
Learn how to restrict what individual builds can do in Jenkins once they're running.
*This needs to be configured according to the needs of your environment.*

link:environment-variables[Handling Environment Variables]::
Improperly written build scripts may be tricked into behaving differently than intended due to special environment variable names or values being injected as build parameters.
This section discusses how to protect your builds.
*This needs to be configured according to the needs of your environment.*

link:securing-jenkins[Other Security Topics]::
This is a placeholder for links to old Wiki articles relevant to Security.
These pages are not currently available.
Some of these articles are obsolete or irrelevant and others need to be rewritten and incorporated into the documentation.

link:services[Exposed Services and Ports]::
Jenkins is a complex application that may expose services on the network.
This chapter provides information about these services.
